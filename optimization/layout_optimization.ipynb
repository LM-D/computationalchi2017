    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### An executable formalism for interaction design \n",
    "\n",
    "*Optimization* refers to both the **outcome** (optimal design) and the **process** of systematically improving a design. Interface design, then, is algorithmic combination of discrete design decisions to obtain an optimal solution defined by an objective function. To *design interaction* is about improving design decisions algorithmically in the light of best information on what makes interaction good for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of combinatorial optimization as an approach to HCI are unique: \n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | What  |\n",
    "|----------|------|\n",
    "|**Constructive** |  The algorithm constructs a full design.   |\n",
    "|**Reductionist AND holist**  |  The goodness of a design choice is considered in the context of the whole design.    |\n",
    "|**Predictive**  |  The objective function makes an explicit and empirically verifiable statement about the 'goodness' of each design.   |\n",
    "|**Systematic**  |  Exploits a wealth of efficient algorithms known in computer science. These offer a higher chance for finding good designs.    |\n",
    "|**Explicit**  |  All assumptions are scrutinable. The system is interpretable and controllable (in principle at least). Cf. black-box approaches in machine learning.   |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are strong rationale for this method in HCI. It offers:\n",
    "* a **rigorous theoretical basis for design**, defining central concepts such as ’design task', 'design space’, ’design objective’, 'design method', and ’optimal design’\n",
    "* **efficient solutions**, exploiting results of decades of research in computer science, and allowing you to attack complex problems with good results and pursue real-time interactive performance\n",
    "* a **flexible toolbox** for automating and adapting designs and for supporting designers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A flexible toolbox for designers\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based combinatorial optimization is a [multidisciplinary approach to computational design](imgs/multidisciplinary-overview.png) inviting contributions from computer scientists, designers, and behavioral scientists. After successful definition of a method, it can be used as a [tool in user-centered design](imgs/ucd.png) and with [data-driven design](imgs/ucd-with-ML.png). \n",
    "\n",
    "**General benefits to practitioners** include:\n",
    "* Improved quality of solutions: Modern optimization methods support designers by offering a high chance of finding good or optimal solutions \n",
    "* Solutions to hard (large, multi-objective) problems\n",
    "* A successful approach can be used repeatedly to different instances of the task.\n",
    "* Integratable with interactive design tools\n",
    "* Information about the complexity and structure of a problem \n",
    "* Estimates of practically achievable improvements possible for a given design\n",
    "* Explicit, scrutinable approach that can support knowledge building in a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, combinatorial optimization can be used not only to find an optimal design but to **assist a designer in various problems encountered in design**, such as:\n",
    "* a unique (maximally different but equally good) solution\n",
    "* a design that strikes the best compromise among competing objectives\n",
    "* a design that is robust to changes in assumptions (e.g., about conditions of use or users)\n",
    "* a design achieved by minimal changes to a current design\n",
    "* a design that is within some k% from the present design. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits if your background is in ...\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HCI**: An executable formalism to analyze, design, and adapt interaction. \n",
    "* **Design**: problem-solving in steroids! Define design problems such that they can be delegated for computers to solve to optimality. (Philosophical note: Donald Schön criticized rationalist approaches to design for reductionism. However, combinatorial optimization is both reductionist and holist: the goodness of a design choice is only determined in the context of the design as a whole.)\n",
    "* **Computer science**: Human-computer interaction offers a new exciting application area for familiar algorithmic and analytical methods. The challenge lies in encoding knowledge about humans in problem definitions.\n",
    "* **Behavioral and cognitive sciences**: Herbert Simon wrote that the proper way to study man is the study of how to design artefacts for them. Optimization offers an important instrument to apply models and theories in practical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warning! \n",
    " \n",
    "Combinatorial optimization is a principled approach that insists on rigorous definitions of the design task and objectives. Be warned about **the costs of rigor**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ramp-up costs: Formal definition and development of search methods can be laborious and risky;\n",
    "2. At times exceedingly hard problems: While modest background in computer science suffices for first probes, real-world cases can be prohibitively hard and insist on professional support;\n",
    "3. Knowledge gap: Defining meaningful objective functions (e.g., aesthetics, learnability) may require support from a cognitive or behavioral scientist with mathematical abilities.\n",

    "# 2. Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization insists on defining a **design task**, consisting of:\n",
    "1. **search space** (design space implemented in code; aka feasible set, candidate set), which is a finite set of alternative designs; \n",
    "2. **objective function**, which defines what you mean by 'good' or 'desirable design';\n",
    "3. **task instance**, which sets task-specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A task defined like this can then be attacked by a **solver**, which goes through the design space to find increasingly better designs. We use this structure in the following exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/optimization.png\" width=\"95%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design task\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, the task is to find the design that yields the highest value of a given objective (goodness) function. This function captures assumptions and knowledge about what makes a design 'good':\n",
    "$$\\max_{d \\in D} f (d)$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "* $d$ is **a candidate design**, \n",
    "* $D$ is the set of all feasible designs, or **design space** (search space), and\n",
    "* $f (\\mathbf{x})$ is **the objective function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this definition is not actionable. Why? Because it does not expose the structure of the design space. The following definition makes **the combinatorial structure of design** more explicit:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Find } \\mathbf{x} =\n",
    "\t\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "\tx_1 \\\\\n",
    "\tx_2 \\\\\n",
    "\t\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "\tx_n\n",
    "\t\\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbf{X}\n",
    "\\mbox{ which maximizes } f(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$ is an *n*-dimensional **design vector**,  each dimension describing a **design variable**, and\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{X}$ is **the set of feasible designs** (all to-be-considered design vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain words, a design is a vector in a multi-dimensional vector space. The objective function assigns each vector a value describing its goodness (or badness). When we optimize, we are looking for the vectors that obtain the highest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design space\n",
    "\n",
    "A design space is the product of design variables under consideration. In a real design problem, some variables are fixed, but some are open. **A design variable** can capture such open decision using familiar types of variables, such as:\n",
    "* boolean (e.g., Do we offer auditory feedback for button press or not?)\n",
    "* integer (e.g., position of an element on x-axis)\n",
    "* real (e.g., hue)\n",
    "* categorical (e.g., type of an element).\n",
    "\n",
    "In combinatorial optimization continuous variables are discretized. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all designs in a design space obtained this way are technically feasible. Consider a hierarchical menu, where a submenu might not be reachable from the top. Functional and other requirements that 'rule out' candidate designs are collectively called **design constraints**. Another example: When designing a Web layout, we should not place elements such that they overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis of problem size\n",
    "\n",
    "The first benefit of this approach is visible now: Defining a design space like this allows examining its size. When we start doing this, we quickly realize that **design spaces in HCI are often exceedingly large**. For example, for $n$ functionality there are $2^n - 1$ ways to combine them to an application, which for only 50 functions means 1,125,899,906,842,623 possibilities. Further, assuming that 50 have been selected, they can be organized into a hierarhical menu in $100! \\approx 10^{158}$ ways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function $f( \\mathbf{x} )$ states what makes a design good. Technically, it is a function that assigns an **objective score (or value)** to each design candidate. The design candidate that obtains the highest (or lowest, when minimizing) score is the **optimum design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HCI, the objective can be anything regarded desirable, such as surface features of the interface (e.g., minimal white space) or expected performance of users (e.g., 'task A should be completed as quickly as possible') and so on. Our opinion is that the quality of a interface should be primarly determined by reference to end-users, for example their performance and experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to obtain a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "While we will later see examples of objective functions, it is good to know that there are many principled (and unprincipled) ways to obtain them:\n",
    "* Literature: A model or theory from prior work\n",
    "* Data-driven approach: Use e.g. statistics or machine learning to obtain a model from data\n",
    "* Standards, guidelines, and design patterns\n",
    "* Heuristics, such as guidelines and best-found practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "After a task has been defined, a solver should be chosen and tuned to attack its instances. We will later look at solvers and their different properties. The process of 'solving' can be intuitively understood as search for highest peaks (when maximizing), or lowest valleys (when minimizing), in a vast 'landscape':\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/landscapes.png\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### A word about the notion of optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization offers a rigorous yet actionable (executable) definition of optimality: To say that a design is optimal is to say that in the defined set of candidate designs, there is no better design (global optimum has been identified). \n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'optimal' is **overused and misused**. In order to claim that a design is optimal, one *must* answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. The best out of which options? (design space)\n",
    "2. The best for what? (design objectives and task instance)\n",
    "3. The best with what guarantees? (search method)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer to the last question defines the 'flavor' of optimality. A design is **globally optimal** when the search method *guarantees* that it achieves the highest objective value in the whole design space. Such guarantees are offered by exhaustive search and exact methods (e.g., integer programming). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we do not have access to those methods, for example because the complexity of the objective function, we cannot claim global optimality. A design is **approximately optimal** when either its objective value is within a defined margin of the optimal design or there is a high chance that only marginally better designs exist. When we have multiple objectives, defining optimality is trickier (Homework: learn the notion of **pareto optimality**)."

    "Subjective goals can be dealt with by two main means: (1) by calibrating weights to correspond to some distribution of preferences, be they designers' or users'; (2) by parametrizing predictive models to correspond to users' individual priorities. For example, user groups might have different distributions of tasks (KLM) or expertise (SDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the choice of modeling formalism affects two critical goals:\n",
    "1. **Predictive validity**: Prediction of desired outcomes in interaction \n",
    "2. **Computational efficiency**:  Minimum time to evaluate a design for a chosen solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choice of formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristics** are rules of thumb used in design,  such as 'white space should be minimized'.  Since most heuristics are 'weak' (carry little information), multiple are needed. This leads to the problem of **conflict resolution**: how to weigh the contribution of one heuristic against another. Another issue of heuristics is their questionable validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics** are expressed as a real-valued functions that capture some feature of a design linked to empirical outcomes. Example: Overplotting metrics in the design of information visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** offers a more expressive yet quickly computable mathematical form of cost functions:\n",
    "$y = f (\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{\\beta} ) + \\epsilon$ . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulator-based models** are step-wise executed functions $M$ that map the model parameters $\\theta$ to data. In HCI, the parameters $\\theta$ capture both parameters of the user and those of the task or context. Simulators are **generative models** that predict not only the outcomes of interaction but intermediate steps, or the process of interaction. A simulator may address multiple design objectives in a coherent manner that require less weight-tuning. However, they are non-linear and significantly more expensive to execute, ruling out exact methods (e.g, integer programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task instance\n",
    "\n",
    "*Task instance* refers to task-specific input values to the design task and objective function, such as:\n",
    "* How many or which elements to place and their properties (sizes, colors etc) \n",
    "* Relative importance of given design objectives (e.g,. is usability more critical than security?)\n",
    "* Inputs expressing properties of targeted user groups, such as goals, capabilities, and interaction styles of users (e.g., what do they want to achieve with the interface?)\n",
    "* Constraints of the interface (e.g., screen resolution, input method).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task instance is specified by designer or inferred from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization method\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern methods in combinatorial optimization can be divided into two main classes: \n",
    "1. **Black-box or heuristic methods** do not make any explicit assumptions on the objective function they are going to optimize, but rather they consider it as a black-box -- like an oracle -- that tells them the objective value of a given candidate. There are deterministic and randomized black-box methods. \n",
    "2. **Exact methods** such as integer programming offer mathematical guarantees for solutions but insist on analysis of the objective function for revealing simplifications and links to known tasks in the optimization literature. We do not discuss exact methods in this unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent summaries of available methods are given in available textbooks. We here expose some main categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heuristic methods\n",
    "\n",
    "If the evaluation of the objective function for a given configuration is inexpensive, then randomized heuristics are often an effective way to obtain solutions of good quality. However, this approach requires some **parameter engineering** to find an apropriate (hyper) parameters (e.g., cooling schedule in simulated annealing). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy algorithms** divide the construction of a solution into multiple subsequent decisions. These decisions are taken in a certain order and are not revoked later. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Local search** relies on a definition of a **neighborhood** of a given design. For example, the neighboring layouts of a keyboard layouts are those that can be constructed by swapping a pair of letters. Starting from an initial configuration, local search proceeds by chosing a neighboring configuration with an objective value that is at least as good as the current one. These choices could be, for example, greedy or randomized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulated Annealing** attempts to solve the issue with local search. A neighboring configuration is not only chosen when it yields to a better objective value but also with a certain probability when it is worse. This probability decreases with the extent of the detoriation of the objective value (temperature). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Meta-heuristics**: Simulated annealing belongs to the class of meta-heuristics: they include hyper parameters to control how to diversify/intensify search and to learn from past solutions. Further members of this class include popular biology-inspired meta-heuristics such as *genetic algorithms* and *ant colony optimization*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exact methods \n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to know that if there is an analytical description of the objective function, then integer programming can be used. It is useful because of guarantees that can be given to quality, but also because of the availability of powerful solvers (e.g., CPLEX and Gurobi).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact methods (e.g, Branch & Bound) are guaranteed to find the optimum solution in finite time. However, this time may be exponential because of NP-completeness of the involved problems. The simplest exact method is **explicit enumeration**, where the objective value of each element of the solution space is evaluated, and the current best solution -- the so-called **incumbent** -- is updated. In **implicit enumeration** relaxations are used to make the problem tractable. If the best objective value of the relaxation restricted to a subset of solutions is worse than the objective value of the incumbent, we can savely discard all solutions from this subset at once, because none of them can replace the incumbent. Moreover, relaxations deliver **guarantees** for the quality of the incumbent, e.g., if the optimum objective value of the incumbent is only 1% away from the optimum objective value of the relaxation, we know that it can also be at most 1% away from the optimum of the original problem. A very popular form of implicit enumeration is Branch and Bound, a standard method for solving Integer (Linear) Programs."

However, applications in realistic problems depend on success in: 1) formal definition of a design task, 2) encoding of meaningful design objectives and knowledge in the objective function, 3) choosing and tuning an efficient solver. After this, the algorithm can be used to support the creative and problem-solving activities of a designer. Different task instances can be solved with the approach once set up.\n",
